What are the top 3 admission types with the highest average ICU costs?,,,"Answer:
The provided SQL query is empty, so I cannot provide an answer to your question. In order to determine the top 3 admission types with the highest average ICU costs, we would need a query that joins the admissions table with relevant tables containing cost information and groups the results by admission type. 

For example, the query might need to join the `admissions` table with tables like `icustays` and potentially `procedureevents_mv` or `inputevents_mv` which seem to contain cost data. Then, it would need to calculate the average cost per admission type and order the results to find the top 3.

Which top 3 patient demographics (gender and age group) show a correlation with specific diagnoses and their treatment protocols?,,,"Answer:
The provided SQL query is empty. Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis of patient demographics, diagnoses, or treatment protocols. 

To answer your question, I would need a SQL query that:

1. **Identifies patient demographics:** This includes selecting the `GENDER` column from the `patients` table and calculating age groups from the `DOB` column.
2. **Links demographics to diagnoses:** This likely involves joining the `patients` table with the `diagnoses_icd` table on the `SUBJECT_ID` column.
3. **Connects diagnoses to treatment protocols:** This is the most complex part and might involve joining with tables like `prescriptions`, `procedures_icd`, or `inputevents_mv` based on the definition of ""treatment protocols"". 
4. **Calculates correlations:** This requires aggregating the data and calculating correlation coefficients or using statistical functions to determine the strength of the relationship between demographics, diagnoses, and treatments.
