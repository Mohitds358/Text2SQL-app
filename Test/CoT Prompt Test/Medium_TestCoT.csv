Calculate the average time between consecutive medication administrations for a specific drug,,"You did not provide me with an SQL query so I cannot answer your question. In order to calculate the average time between consecutive medication administrations for a specific drug, I need the name of the drug and an SQL query that calculates the average time between administrations of that drug. 

For example, if you wanted to know the average time between administrations of Heparin, you would need to provide an SQL query that returns that information.
