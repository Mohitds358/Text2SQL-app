NLQ,SQL Query,Answer
Show the first 5 records from the admissions table.,SELECT * FROM admissions LIMIT 5;,"Answer:
The table shows the first 5 patient admissions to the hospital.  Each row represents a single admission event, with details such as the admission time, discharge time, admission type, insurance type, diagnosis, and more. For example, the first row shows that patient 10006 was admitted to the hospital on 2164-10-23 at 21:09 with a diagnosis of sepsis. They were admitted through the emergency room and discharged to home health care on 2164-11-01."
List all distinct admission types.,"SELECT DISTINCT ADMISSION_TYPE
FROM admissions;","The SQL query successfully returned all the distinct admission types present in the database. There are three distinct admission types:

* **ELECTIVE:** This suggests a scheduled admission, planned in advance.
* **EMERGENCY:** This signifies an unscheduled admission due to a serious and unexpected medical condition requiring immediate attention.
* **URGENT:** This indicates an unscheduled admission for a condition that requires prompt attention but is not an immediate life-threatening emergency."
Count the number of patients admitted.,"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT SUBJECT_ID)
FROM admissions;","Answer:
There were 100 patients admitted. 

**Explanation:**

* The query is asking for a count of distinct `SUBJECT_ID` values from the `admissions` table. 
* Each unique `SUBJECT_ID` represents a unique patient.
* The SQL response `[(100,)]` means there were 100 distinct patient IDs found in the `admissions` table."
How many female patients are there?,"SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM patients
WHERE gender = 'F';","Answer:
There are 55 female patients in the database. 

**Explanation:**

* The query counted all rows in the ""patients"" table where the ""gender"" column is equal to 'F'. 
* The database returned a count of 55, representing the number of female patients."
List all unique admission locations.,SELECT DISTINCT ADMISSION_LOCATION FROM admissions;,"The SQL query returned a list of 5 unique admission locations:

* EMERGENCY ROOM ADMIT
* TRANSFER FROM HOSP/EXTRAM
* PHYS REFERRAL/NORMAL DELI
* CLINIC REFERRAL/PREMATURE
* TRANSFER FROM SKILLED NUR 

This means that in our database, patients were admitted to the hospital from these 5 different locations."
Count the number of patients who died during admission.,"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT SUBJECT_ID)
FROM admissions
WHERE DEATHTIME IS NOT NULL;","Answer:
There were 100 patients who died during their admission to the hospital. 

**Explanation:**

1. **The query focuses on the `admissions` table, which contains information about each patient's hospital admission.**
2. **It specifically looks for records where the `DEATHTIME` column is NOT NULL.**  This means the query is identifying admissions where the patient died.
3. **`COUNT(DISTINCT SUBJECT_ID)` calculates the number of unique patients.**  Each patient is identified by a unique `SUBJECT_ID`. Using ""DISTINCT"" ensures we count each patient only once, even if they had multiple admissions. 

Therefore, the result (100) tells us that out of all the admissions recorded in the database, 100 of them involved unique patients who unfortunately died during their stay."

List all diagnoses for subject ID 10006.,"SELECT
  d.ICD9_CODE
FROM diagnoses_icd AS d
WHERE
  d.SUBJECT_ID = 10006;","Subject ID 10006 had the following diagnoses associated with their medical record: 99591, 99662, 5672, 40391, 42731, 4280, 4241, 4240, 2874, 03819, 7850, E8791, V090, 56211, 28529, 25000, V5867, E9342, 41401, 2749, and 3051.  These are likely codes from a standardized medical coding system such as ICD-9."
Find the total number of unique diagnoses.,"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ICD9_CODE)
FROM diagnoses_icd;","Answer:
There are a total of 581 unique diagnoses in the diagnoses_icd table. 

**Explanation:**

1. **The user wants to know the total number of unique diagnoses.** This means we need to look at the table that stores diagnosis information and count the distinct codes associated with those diagnoses.
2. **The SQL query achieves this by:**
   - `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ICD9_CODE)`: This part counts the number of distinct 'ICD9_CODE' entries.  'ICD9_CODE' likely refers to a code system used for classifying diagnoses. Using 'DISTINCT' ensures we only count each unique code once.
   - `FROM diagnoses_icd`: This specifies that we are looking for these codes within the 'diagnoses_icd' table.
3. **The SQL response returned: (581,)** 
   - This means there are 581 unique ICD9_CODE entries found in the diagnoses_icd table.

**In simpler terms:** The database has a table storing information about diagnoses. Each diagnosis is assigned a unique code. The query counted all the different diagnosis codes and found 581, meaning there are 581 unique diagnoses recorded in the database."

Count the number of patients admitted to the emergency room.,"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT SUBJECT_ID)
FROM admissions
WHERE ADMISSION_LOCATION = 'EMERGENCY ROOM';","Answer:
There were no patients admitted through the emergency room in this dataset. 

**Explanation:**

1. **The question asks for a count of patients specifically admitted through the ER.**
2. **The SQL query looks at the `admissions` table and counts the distinct `SUBJECT_ID`  (which represents unique patients) where `ADMISSION_LOCATION` is 'EMERGENCY ROOM'.** 
3. **The SQL response returned a count of 0.**

**Conclusion:** This means that while the database contains information on patients, none of the records show an admission location of 'EMERGENCY ROOM'. It's possible there are other admission locations in the data, or that this dataset is filtered for a specific purpose."
Check for unique CURR_CAREUNIT.,SELECT DISTINCT CURR_CAREUNIT FROM callout;,"The SQL query returned a list of unique values for the ""CURR_CAREUNIT"" column in the ""callout"" table. 

This means the query found five distinct care units where patients were present at the time of callout:

What is the current ward ID for subject ID 10089 who was admitted?,"SELECT CURR_WARDID
FROM callout
WHERE HADM_ID = (SELECT MAX(HADM_ID) FROM admissions WHERE SUBJECT_ID = 10089);","Answer:
        The provided SQL query returned no results. This indicates that there is no information available regarding the current ward ID for subject ID 10089 in the 'callout' table. 

        Here's why:

        1. **Finding the most recent admission:** The query first tries to find the most recent admission (highest HADM_ID) for subject ID 10089 from the 'admissions' table. 
        2. **Looking for a match:** Then, using that HADM_ID, it tries to find a matching entry in the 'callout' table to retrieve the 'CURR_WARDID'.
        3. **No match found:** The empty result means either subject ID 10089 doesn't exist in either table, or there's no callout record associated with their most recent admission."

  ON t1.ICUSTAY_ID = t2.ICUSTAY_ID
WHERE
  t2.FIRST_WARDID = 50;","Answer:
There were 16 patients admitted to ward ID 50. 

Explanation:
The SQL query joins the 'transfers' and 'icustays' tables based on a common ICU stay ID (ICUSTAY_ID). It then filters the results to only include stays where the first ward ID (FIRST_WARDID) was 50. Finally, it counts the distinct patient IDs (SUBJECT_ID) to give us the number of unique patients who were first admitted to ward 50."

WHERE d_cpt.SECTIONHEADER = 'Cardiovascular';","Answer:
        This query returns a list of unique patient IDs (SUBJECT_ID) who have undergone a cardiovascular procedure. 

        Here's how it works:

        1. **Joining Tables:** The query combines data from the 'cptevents' table and the 'd_cpt' table. The 'cptevents' table likely contains information about specific procedures performed on patients, while the 'd_cpt' table seems to hold descriptions and categories for different procedure codes.
        2. **Filtering by Section Header:** It specifically looks for procedures where the 'SECTIONHEADER' in the 'd_cpt' table is 'Cardiovascular'. This means we are focusing on procedures that fall under the category of cardiovascular.
        3. **Selecting Subject IDs:** The query then picks out the distinct 'SUBJECT_ID' values. This ensures that each patient is listed only once, even if they have had multiple cardiovascular procedures.

        In simpler terms, the query identifies all patients who have undergone at least one cardiovascular procedure."
List all distinct section headers from the cptevents table for subject ID 10117.,"SELECT DISTINCT SECTIONHEADER
