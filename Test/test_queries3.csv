**Key Findings:**

* **MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit):** 
    * Patients below 50 years old were prescribed an average of 38 medications.
    * Patients aged 50-70 received an average of 42 medications.
    * Patients above 70 years old were prescribed an average of 34 medications.

* **CCU (Cardiac Care Unit):**
    * Patients below 50: Average of 143 medications (This number seems high and might be worth investigating further).
    * Patients 50-70: Average of 32 medications.
    * Patients above 70: Average of 41 medications.

* **SICU (Surgical Intensive Care Unit):**
    * Patients below 50: Average of 75 medications.
    * Patients 50-70: Average of 36 medications.
    * Patients above 70: Average of 33 medications.

* **CSRU (Cardiothoracic Surgical Recovery Unit):**
    * Patients 50-70: Average of 45 medications.
    * Patients above 70: Average of 36 medications.

* **TSICU (Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit):**
    * Patients below 50: Average of 45 medications.
    * Patients 50-70: Average of 24 medications.
    * Patients above 70: Average of 25 medications. 

**Important Note:**  The average medication count for the CCU in the ""below 50"" age group is unusually high. This could indicate a data anomaly or a specific case that requires further investigation."

'AvgStayLength', shown as a large decimal number, represents the average length of their hospital stays in seconds.
