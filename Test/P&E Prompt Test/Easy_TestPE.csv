List subject IDs who were admitted in the year 2118.,"SELECT DISTINCT SUBJECT_ID
FROM admissions
WHERE strftime('%Y', ADMITTIME) = '2118';","The query you wrote returned an error because the database system you're using doesn't support the `strftime()` function in the way it's used.  The `strftime()` function is commonly used to format dates and times, but its availability and specific features can vary across different database systems.

To get a list of subject IDs admitted in the year 2118, you'll need to adjust the query based on the specific functions your database system supports for extracting the year from a date. 

For example, if your system uses a function like `YEAR()`, the query could look like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT SUBJECT_ID
FROM admissions
WHERE YEAR(ADMITTIME) = 2118;
