Unfortunately, the SQL response is empty, meaning there is no data available to calculate the mortality rate for the given criteria. This could be due to various reasons, such as:

* **No matching records:** There might be no patients who meet both conditions of staying in the ICU for more than 48 hours and having at least one procedure. 
* **Missing data:** There might be incomplete data in the tables, such as missing procedure information for some patients.

To get a clearer picture, we would need to investigate the data further or adjust the query to potentially relax the criteria."

2. **Filtering for heart failure:** It focuses specifically on admissions where the diagnosis is 'HEART FAILURE'.
3. **Grouping by medication:** It groups the results by the generic name of the prescribed drug.
4. **Counting prescriptions:** For each group (i.e., each medication), it counts how many times it was prescribed.
5. **Ordering by prescription count:** It orders the results in descending order of the prescription count, so the most prescribed medication appears first.
6. **Limiting to top 3:** It only returns the top 3 results, giving us the three most common medications.

Unfortunately, I cannot answer your question using a SQL query on this database. This database contains information about hospital admissions, patient demographics, and medical procedures performed, but it lacks information on the timing or types of treatments administered.  Therefore, it's impossible to identify treatments and their correlation with mortality rates based on this data. 

To answer your question, I would need a dataset that includes:

* **Treatment details:**  The type of treatments given to each patient.
* **Timing of treatments:** When each treatment was administered relative to the hospitalization time.
* **Patient outcomes:**  Information on whether patients recovered or passed away during their hospital stay.
